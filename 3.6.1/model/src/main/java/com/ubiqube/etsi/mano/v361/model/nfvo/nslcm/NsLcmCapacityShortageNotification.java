/**
 * This type represents an NS LCM capacity shortage notification, which informs the receiver about resource shortage conditions during the execution of NS LCM operations. The notifications are triggered by the NFVO when a capacity shortage condition occurs during the execution of an NS LCM operation, which fails due to the resource shortage, or which succeeds despite the resource shortage because the NFVO has reduced the resource consumption of other NSs by requesting these NSs to be scaled in or terminated. The notification shall comply with the provisions defined in Table 6.5.2.19-1. The support of the notification is mandatory. This notification shall be triggered by the NFVO when there is a capacity shortage condition during the execution of an NS LCM operation which will cause the LCM operation to be not successfully completed, or which will trigger the automatic executing of an LCM operation to reduce the resource consumption of one or more NS instances to resolve a resource shortage situation. The shortage conditions include: • Necessary resources could not be allocated during an LCM operation because of resource shortage which causes   the LCM operation to fail. • An LCM operation on an NS instance with higher priority pre-empted an LCM operation on NS instance with lower   priority because of resource shortage. • An LCM operation on an NS instance with higher priority pre-empted an existing NS instance. Resources were   de-allocated from the lower priority NS instance to allow the LCM operation on a higher priority NS instance. • The resource capacity shortage situation has ended, and it can be expected that an LCM operation that had   failed could succeed now if retried.  NOTE: ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [x] defines further shortage situations.       These are not supported by the present version of the present document.  This notification shall also be triggered by the NFVO when a shortage condition has ended that has previously led to NS LCM operation occurrences failing. The notification shall be sent to all API consumers (OSS/BSS) that have subscribed to notifications related to capacity shortage and meeting the filter conditions of all pre-empted (low priority) and all pre-empting (high priority NS instance(s)). See ETSI GS NFV-IFA 010 [2], Annex D.2 for the use cases. The notification about the result of an unsuccessful LCM operation occurrence shall include appropriate information about the resource shortage when the cause for failure is a resource shortage. The notification where a pre-emption occurred due to e.g. a higher priority LCM operation during resource shortage shall include appropriate information about the pre-emption. NOTE:     Not all operation occurrences that are in \&quot;FAILED_TEMP\&quot; have been pre-empted by a resource shortage.           When the operation occurrences were pre-empted, the NS instances affected by the resource shortage end           (“status“ &#x3D; \&quot;LCM_SHORTAGE_END\&quot;) which are pointed by \&quot;affectedNsId\&quot; in the list of \&quot;affectedOpOccs\&quot; structure           can have the operations retried again (which needs a request by the OSS/BSS).  NOTE 1: The present version of the present document supports only the resource shortage status enumeration           values “LCM_RESOURCES_NOT_AVAILABLE” and “LCM_SHORTAGE_END” which represent a subset of the trigger conditions           defined in clause 8.3.5.2  of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [x].
